                <p>Hi I'm Joshua Teles! I am majoring in Computer Science. I am currently enrolled at Weber State
                University and am in WEB 1430 and CS 1410. I am interested in Game Design, I love programming, 
                and I really like learning new skills. I enjoy hiking and love gaming. My favorite games
                right now are Hades(2020) and Helldivers 2. I'm constantly bouncing between hobbies. 
                The usual culprits are video editing, drawing, movies, soccer, painting, painting miniatures,
                running some D&D, reading, or writing</p>
            </div>
            <div class="block2">
                <p>
                    I have worked with Python, and am focused on learning to use JavaScript, HTML, C++, and GDscript.
                    This is my portfolio website where I will upload and showcase my JavaScript projects in WEB 1430.
